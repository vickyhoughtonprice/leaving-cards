All the very best for whatever comes next, Benjy. I wish we'd got to work together on a project. I hope our paths cross again. Jon.

Wishing and hoping I get a chance to work/learn from you in teh future, sad I missed the chance here :( Good luck with the world of contract, hope it's interesting work, but allows you to spend more time on the welsh coast :blue_heart: :dragon:
